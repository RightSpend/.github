# RightSpend

This repo serves as the location for all the [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) used by our development teams.

It is a public repo on purpose, as this is required for the templates to work correctly.
